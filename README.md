## EVAN SAYS:
I put a certain type of Navbar in the search and results page. I mostly wanted to test them, and they seem appealing. We have time to discuss options though, so this could always change. I may give them limited functionality.

## ADAM SAYS:
so I have no idea what we want on our homepage I'll have to add more too it.
